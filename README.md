Real-time collaborative filtering for item-item similarities

LATEST ISSUES:

-NOT SURE ABOUT THE COSINE SIMILARITY CALCULATION. IT NEEDS TESTING WITH A SMALLER AND MORE CONTROLLABLE DATASET

-YOU MUST INSTALL AND CONFIGURE REDIS ON YOUR LOCALS ASAP!!! FEEL FREE WITH CHANGING THE PORTS ON EACH SCRIPT

-THE TEST RUN IS LIKE THIS: FIRE UP s1.py, client.py, s2.py and s3.py in order for best tests

-S2.PY FAILS AT SOME POINT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING RELATED WITH REDIS FUNCTIONS SADD AND HSET (I THINK IT'S A MINOR ISSUE)
